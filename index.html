                    <p>Working at Parchment has been a great learning experience for me. The startup environment allowed me to shape my work
                    and be creative, which was both exciting and challenging. I had the opportunity to learn new technologies like .NET,
                    Swift, and Quill, a framework built by Parchment, while also becoming familiar with the codebase. Collaborating with
                    talented people on various tasks helped me improve my problem-solving skills, especially since the lack of structure
                    compared to a big company made it stressful at times. I also learned to manage my time more effectively and prioritize
                    tasks. This experience has not only made me a better programmer but also taught me the importance of teamwork and
                    adaptability. It has been rewarding to see how my contributions fit into the larger project. I’m grateful for this
                    opportunity, as it has prepared me for the bigger challenges I’ll face in a real job. I look forward to seeing
                    Parchment's future developments and hope to apply these lessons in my future career.</p>

                        My experience with Parchment has been very insightful and I have learned so much throughout this process. I worked alongside a wide variety of people on many different tasks 
                        all this year and familiarized myself with Parchment's codebase, new programming languages, and new tools. I have learned a lot about the software development process and
                        met a lot of great people. While not everything was perfect, I found it to be very valuable to learning about the troubles and successes of a software development team can face
                        especially in a remote setting. The nature of Parchment being a startup allowed me to have more control in the direction of my work and how I approached it with my team in a more
                        free flowing way. Being tasked to learn new things such a .NET devolpment basics and Swift has helped me build a solid set of skills I can take into my future programming. Seeing
                        my work come to life in the application was very rewarding. I really enjoyed getting to know and work with so many people beyond my core team and having the chance to dip my hands
                        into so many different parts of the application was challenging in the best way possible. I also found the process of developing a new feature from start to finish to be very insightful
                        in terms of learning best practices and strategies for developing with a small team. I am very grateful for the opportunity to work with everyone at Parchment and I am excited to see how the 
                        application evolves in the future.

                    <p>Working for Captured Sun on their Parchment application allowed me to work on a really interesting product while gaining valuable experience.
                        My previous internships have taken place at large companies, so it was exciting to spend some time in a fast paced startup.
                        The team based structure of Parchment's development simultaneously gave me more independence to experiment with my own solutions
                        while requiring me to interact with other teams when features crossed areas of the project.
                        During sprints to complete tasks for Parchment I gained experience understanding a large and complicated code base and how
                        to add features while following existing code practices.
                        While I have practiced javascript in the past through classes and personal projects, it was gratifying to see how a larger project
                        chose to implement libraries, as well has learning to work with their in house Quill framework.
                        Overall, working at Parchment has helped to refresh my interpersonal and technical skills as well as aiding my transition into the workforce.</p>

                    <p>Reflecting on my internship with Captured Sun’s Parchment project, I’m filled with gratitude for an experience that
                        significantly advanced my career and personal goals. Aspiring to be a Product Manager, I was 
                        thrilled to work as a Technical Product Manager, blending my technical skills with strategic 
                        product development. This role offered a comprehensive view of the entire product lifecycle, 
                        aligning perfectly with my career ambitions.The startup environment at Captured Sun was 
                        dynamic and fast-paced, teaching me to embrace ambiguity and adapt quickly. This experience 
                        honed my decision-making skills and allowed me to produce my best work even in uncertain 
                        situations.Technically, I improved my HTML and CSS styling skills, learned Swift, and got 
                        better at analyzing backend code more efficiently. Additionally, working in a larger company 
                        setting provided me with insights into the complexities of product management and team 
                        collaboration. Overall, my time at Captured Sun was incredibly rewarding, equipping me with 
                        valuable skills and experiences that have prepared me for future challenges in the tech 
                        industry. I'm excited to apply these lessons as I continue my career journey.
