                My experience with Parchment has been very insightful and I have learned so much throughout this process. I worked alongside a wide variety of people on many different tasks 
                all this year and familiarized myself with Parchment's codebase, new programming languages, and new tools. I have learned a lot about the software development process and
                met a lot of great people. While not everything was perfect, I found it to be very valuable to learning about the troubles and successes of a software development team can face
                especially in a remote setting. The nature of Parchment being a startup allowed me to have more control in the direction of my work and how I approached it with my team in a more
                free flowing way. Being tasked to learn new things such a .NET devolpment basics and Swift has helped me build a solid set of skills I can take into my future programming. Seeing
                my work come to life in the application was very rewarding. I really enjoyed getting to know and work with so many people beyond my core team and having the chance to dip my hands
                into so many different parts of the application was challenging in the best way possible. I also found the process of developing a new feature from start to finish to be very insightful
                in terms of learning best practices and strategies for developing with a small team. I am very grateful for the opportunity to work with everyone at Parchment and I am excited to see how the 
                application evolves in the future.
